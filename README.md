# RSA vs Post-Quantum Cryptography (Kyber) Research

## Overview
This repository contains my research project comparing **classical RSA encryption** with **Post-Quantum Cryptography (Kyber)**.  
The project explores how quantum computing threatens traditional cryptographic systems and why Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is essential for securing future communications.

## Contents
- ðŸ“‚ `code/` â†’ Python scripts for plotting graphs and running simulations  
- ðŸ“‚ `graphs/` â†’ Performance comparison graphs (RSA vs Kyber)  
- ðŸ“‚ `paper/` â†’ Draft of the research paper (LaTeX & PDF)  

## Key Points
- RSA is efficient today but vulnerable to Shorâ€™s algorithm on quantum computers.  
- PQC methods like Kyber offer quantum-resistant alternatives.  
- Our experiments highlight the trade-offs: PQC is slower in encryption/decryption but stronger in security and faster in key generation.  

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress â€” currently refining graphs and expanding the paper to include real-world limitations and references.
